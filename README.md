## Analyzing the drug dataset
We have a drug dataset that and we want to analyzed the data for prediction with the following variables:

*Independent variables
1. Age
2. Sex – (0 for Male, 1 for Female)
3. BP - Blood Pressure Level (0 for Normal, 1 for Low, 2 for High)
4. Cholesterol - Cholesterol Level (0 for Normal, 1 for High)
5. Na_to_K - Sodium to Potassium Ration

*Dependent variables
1. Drug: Drug Type in system (drugA, drugB, drugC, drugX, drugY)

## Prediction analysis to be done with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) to check which one is better
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a controlled machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regressions challenges
2. But it is mostly used in classification challenges
3. SVM can easily handle multiple continuous and categorical variables
4. The main objective of SVM is to segregate the data in the best possible way

Naïve Bayes (NB)
1. Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task 
2. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem
3. The assumption under this is the independence among predictors 
4. NB assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature
5. NB is mostly useful for large data sets and is known to outclass other sophisticated classification methods 
6. Biggest disadvantage of NB is the requirement of predictors to be independent

## Prerequisities

* [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>
We will need to import pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and %matplotlib inline

## Installing

...Need to **load** the drug dataset that needs to be analyzed
...**Variables** to be created
...**Drop** the dependent variable

## Running the tests for SVM and NB

* Scale the data
* Import SVC, GaussianNB and classification_report, confusion_matrix
* Run the SVM and NB script

## Output will include
Confusion matrix, weighted average scores for precision, recall, f1 score and support
